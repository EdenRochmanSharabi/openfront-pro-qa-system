üìÑ FILE: ./openfrontpro.com/beginners-guide.html
------------------------------------------------------------
OpenFront Pro - Your Ultimate OpenFront.io Companion
OpenFront.io Complete Beginner‚Äôs Guide
What is OpenFront.io?
OpenFront.io is a
real-time strategy browser game
where players compete to dominate the world map. The game combines territorial expansion, economic management, diplomatic alliances, and nuclear warfare in an engaging multiplayer experience.
Victory is achieved by controlling 80% of all non-irradiated land
, making it a race to expand while preventing others from reaching that threshold.
The game features simple controls but deep strategic mechanics, making it accessible to newcomers while offering complexity for experienced players. You play against other human players, AI bots, and Nations (stronger AI) in real-time matches that can last anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour.
Understanding the Basics
Game Objective
Your primary goal is to
control 80% of the total map‚Äôs non-irradiated land
to win. This means:
You must expand your territory through conquest
Nuclear weapons create radioactive zones that don‚Äôt count toward anyone‚Äôs percentage
The first player to reach 80% wins the match
Other players can be eliminated if they lose all their territory
Starting the Game
When you join a match, you‚Äôll first select your
starting position
on the map. This is one of the most crucial decisions you‚Äôll make:
Choose areas with:
Plains terrain (light green) for fastest expansion
Access to water for naval gameplay
Multiple bots nearby for easy early expansion
Distance from other human players
Avoid areas with:
Mountain terrain (white) that‚Äôs slow to capture
Being surrounded by multiple human players
No access to water or bots
Core Game Mechanics
Population and Growth System
Population is the foundation of your empire. Understanding the
population growth curve
is essential for success:
Each tile you own provides 3 population
Population grows fastest at approximately 42% of your maximum capacity
Growth slows significantly above 80% capacity
Workers reproduce 30% faster than troops
Managing Your Population Balance:
You must divide your population between two roles:
Troops
: Defend your territory and conduct attacks
Workers
: Generate gold income and reproduce faster
The optimal balance changes throughout the game, depending on your needs. In the early game we recommend to keep 80-90% of your population as troops for expansion and defense. As you progress, shift more to workers for economic growth and sustainability if the need for expansion diminishes.
Terrain Types and Combat
The game features three terrain types that significantly affect combat:
Plains (Light Green)
Easiest and fastest to capture
15% speed bonus for attacks
10% fewer casualties for attackers
Best for rapid early expansion
Highlands/Deserts (Tan/Orange)
Moderate difficulty to capture
Normal attack speed
Standard casualty rates
Balanced terrain for general gameplay
Mountains (White)
Hardest and slowest to capture
25% speed penalty for attacks
30% more casualties for attackers
Excellent for defensive positions and cities
Attack Ratio System
The
attack ratio slider
controls what percentage of your troops participate in each attack. This is crucial for managing your expansion:
10-30%
: Conservative expansion, maintains strong defense
30-50%
: Balanced approach for moderate expansion
75%+
: Aggressive expansion but leaves you vulnerable
Higher ratios capture territory faster but leave fewer troops for defense. The optimal ratio depends on your situation and nearby threats.
Essential Buildings and Structures
Cities
Cities are your most important buildings, providing
+25,000 population capacity each
. They‚Äôre essential for scaling your empire:
Cost Structure:
First city: 125,000 gold
Second city: 250,000 gold
Third city: 500,000 gold
Fourth city and onwards: 1,000,000 gold
Placement Strategy:
Build on mountain terrain for natural defense
Place in central locations for maximum territory coverage
Keep them away from borders and coasts to avoid easy capture
Build early and often - they‚Äôre the foundation of growth
Ports
Ports unlock naval gameplay and provide crucial economic benefits:
Functions:
Enable construction of warships for naval control
Generate
automatic trade ships
that create gold income
Allow amphibious attacks across water
Trade income scales with distance
- longer routes generate more gold
Trade Income Formula:
Gold earned = 10,000 + 150 √ó (distance^1.1)
This means a trade route of 200 tiles generates about
57,434 gold
, while a 20-tile route only generates
13,680 gold
.
Defense Posts
Defense posts provide the strongest defensive bonus in the game:
Defensive Multipliers:
5√ó defense bonus
in a 30-tile radius
6√ó bonus
when built on mountains (stacks with terrain)
4.5√ó bonus
on plains
Multiple defense posts don‚Äôt stack
Strategic Uses:
Protect cities and important infrastructure
Control chokepoints and strategic passages
Create defensive lines along borders
Force enemies to commit massive armies to break through
Missile Systems
Missile Silos
(1,000,000 gold) allow you to launch nuclear weapons:
Atom Bomb
(750,000 gold): Small area destruction
Hydrogen Bomb
(5,000,000 gold): Large area devastation
MIRV
(25,000,000 gold): Destroys entire nations, cannot be intercepted
SAM Launchers
(1,500,000 gold) defend against nuclear attacks:
75% interception rate
for Atom and Hydrogen bombs
75-pixel range
around the launcher
7.5-second cooldown
between interceptions
Cannot intercept MIRVs
Warships
Warships control naval territories and trade routes:
Combat Capabilities:
Start with 500 health, grow to 1,000 maximum
250 damage per shot every 2 seconds
130-tile targeting range
Automatically patrol assigned areas
Strategic Functions:
Capture enemy trade ships
for economic warfare
Destroy enemy boats attempting naval invasions
Control sea lanes and strategic waterways
Support your own trade routes
Early Game Strategy (First 10 Minutes)
Perfect Opening Sequence
The first few minutes determine your entire game trajectory:
Wait 2-3 seconds
for population to stabilize
Set attack ratio to 30-35%
for controlled expansion
Capture all neutral territory
in your immediate area
Wait for 15,000+ population
before attacking bots
Build your first city
as soon as you have 125,000 gold
Bot Rushing Strategy
Bots are your primary source of early expansion and gold:
Bot Characteristics:
Always attack with exactly 50% of their troops
Never build structures or use advanced tactics
Provide significant gold rewards when defeated
Can be easily surrounded for instant annexation
Optimal Bot Strategy:
Target weakest bots first
for easy victories
Look for annexation opportunities
- surrounding bots instantly captures them with zero losses
Maintain 30-50% population capacity
for optimal growth during expansion
Save some troops
to defend against human player attacks
Annexation Technique
Annexation is the most powerful conquest mechanic in the game:
How it Works:
Completely surround enemy territory with your own
Instantly capture
all enclosed land
with
zero troop losses
Works on bots, players, and neutral territory
Cannot annex territory touching water or map edges
Strategic Priority:
Always look for annexation opportunities before direct attacks
Much more efficient than traditional combat
Can eliminate entire players in one move
Essential for bot rushing in early game
Diplomacy and Alliance System
Alliance Benefits and Risks
Alliances are crucial to survive in the early game.
When allies betray you, they suffer -50% defense for 30 seconds from all attacks, making them less likely to break alliances
All alliances are temporary. They will automatically expire after a couple minutes. Form them for mutual benefit, but be prepared for inevitable betrayal. Consider terrain when choosing allies to protect vulnerable borders and create strategic buffers.
Strategic Alliance Management
Early Game Alliances:
Form defensive pacts with nearby players to focus on bot expansion
Ally with players who share borders with strong bots
Avoid alliances that force you into conflicts you can‚Äôt win
Mid Game Coordination:
Share information about enemy nuclear programs
Coordinate expansion into different regions
Late Game Considerations:
Plan for inevitable betrayal as victory approaches
Consider betraying when you can reach 80% land control
Use alliances to prevent others from winning
Naval Warfare and Trade
Understanding Trade Mechanics
Trade ships automatically generate income between your ports and other players‚Äô ports:
Trade Optimization:
Build ports on multiple bodies of water
for redundant income
Longer trade routes generate exponentially more gold
Allied players‚Äô ports are prioritized
for trade
Trade stops automatically during combat
and resumes after 5 minutes
Economic Impact:
A single long-distance trade route can generate more income than dozens of short routes. Prioritize building ports on different continents when possible.
Warship Strategy
Warships serve both economic and military functions:
Economic Warfare:
Capture enemy trade ships
to steal their income
Destroy enemy warships
protecting their trade routes
Control strategic waterways
to dominate trade
Military Applications:
Patrol key areas
to prevent enemy naval invasions
Support amphibious attacks
on enemy coastlines
Destroy enemy boats
attempting to bypass your defenses
Nuclear Warfare
Nuclear Weapon Types and Uses
Nuclear weapons are the ultimate strategic tool for reshaping the battlefield:
Atom Bombs
(750,000 gold):
Small blast radius
for precise strikes
Best for destroying 1-2 enemy structures
Cost-effective
for tactical strikes
Can be intercepted by SAM launchers
Hydrogen Bombs
(5,000,000 gold):
Large blast radius
for area denial
Destroys multiple structures in clustered areas
Creates
radioactive wasteland
that doesn‚Äôt count for victory
Can be intercepted by SAM launchers, but also outranges SAMs when aimed correctly
MIRV
(25,000,000 gold):
Destroys entire enemy nations
Cannot be intercepted
by any defense
Most powerful weapon
in the game
Often decisive in late-game scenarios
Nuclear Defense Strategy
SAM Launcher Networks:
Build overlapping coverage
around cities and key infrastructure
75% interception rate
provides good but not perfect protection
Cannot stop MIRVs
- the ultimate nuclear threat
7.5-second cooldown
means multiple quick strikes can overwhelm them
Strategic Considerations:
Nuclear deterrence
: Having nukes prevents others from using theirs
First strike advantage
: Can eliminate threats before they respond
Economic targeting
: Destroy enemy cities and infrastructure
Area denial
: Create radioactive barriers to movement
Advanced Strategies
Mid-Game Transitions
As the game progresses beyond the initial bot rush phase:
Economic Development:
Build 3-4 cities
for massive population capacity
Establish multiple ports
for diversified trade income
Develop nuclear capabilities
for deterrence and offense
Create defensive networks
with SAM launchers and defense posts
Strategic Positioning:
Control chokepoints
to limit enemy movement
Secure resource-rich regions
with multiple bots and ports
Build defensive depth
with layered fortifications
Maintain flexibility
to respond to threats and opportunities
Late Game Victory Paths
Expansion Victory:
Rapid annexation
of smaller players and remaining bots
Chain conquests
to quickly reach 80% land control
Speed over caution
when victory is within reach
Nuclear Victory:
MIRV enemy threats
before they can reach 80%
Destroy enemy infrastructure
to cripple their growth
Create radioactive barriers
to prevent enemy expansion
Diplomatic Victory:
Alliance manipulation
to prevent any single player from winning
Calculated betrayals
when you can secure victory
Information warfare
to coordinate against the leading player

Warships Guide for OpenFront.io
Main Takeaway:
Warships are pivotal naval units that deter enemy trade, secure your ports‚Äô income streams, and defend coastal territories. Properly acquiring, positioning, and employing warships can shift mid- and late-game momentum in your favor.
1. Overview and Acquisition
What Is a Warship?
A
Warship
is a boat-type building that:
Attacks enemy transports and warships.
Captures rival trade ships, redirecting their gold to you.
Starts with 500 HP and can heal up to 1 000 HP when you control at least one port.
How to Build
Port Requirement:
Must own at least one Port.
Build Menu:
Right-click any water tile ‚Üí yellow wrench icon ‚Üí select
Warship
.
Spawn Location:
Appears at your nearest port and sails to the targeted tile.
Cost Scaling
1st Warship: 250 000 gold
Each additional: +250 000 gold, capped at 1 000 000 gold
Formula:
cost = min(1 000 000, (numWarships + 1) * 250 000)
.
2. Core Properties

(for capture)
Engagement Rules
Automatic Patrol:
Warships patrol their assigned sector when idle.
Auto-Engagement:
They fire on any hostile naval unit entering range.
Chase & Capture:
Upon detecting an enemy trade ship (not heading to your ports), they double speed (2 tiles/tick) to intercept and capture it, converting it to your nation‚Äôs vessel.
Return to Patrol:
After engagements, they resume patrolling.
4. Strategic Roles
4.1 Trade Denial & Income Theft
By placing warships along enemy trade routes or chokepoints, you can:
Intercept Trade Ships:
Steal gold that would otherwise reach rival ports.
Economic Warfare:
Deny opponents resources to slow their expansion.
Tip:
Deploy your first warship early on your most contested sea border to maximize interceptions.
4.2 Coastal Defense
Warships serve as mobile coastal batteries:
Protect against enemy transports during amphibious assaults.
Support defense posts by thinning attacking naval forces.
Tip:
Position warships near your flanks to shield weaker backline allies and prevent enemy boat raids.
4.3 Fleet Support
In team games, warships can:
Escort Trade Ships:
Escort allied trade convoys to safety.
Engage Enemy Fleets:
Skirmish small enemy naval groups to establish sea control.
5. Optimal Usage Tips
Early Investment:
Build at least one warship after your first port to begin intercepting trade.
Choke Points:
Identify narrow waterways or river mouths‚Äîideal for ambushes.
Incremental Builds:
Consider cost scaling; refrain from over-building until mid-game economics improve.
Combined Arms:
Support warships with nearby ports for continuous repair and with defense posts for layered coastal defense.
Mobility Exploits:
Use manual movement (left-click highlight ‚Üí target water) to outmaneuver slower enemy vessels.
6. Common Pitfalls
Overextension:
Sending warships too deep without support risks losing high-value units.
Neglected Ports:
Without ports, warships cannot heal or capture trade effectively.
Cost Mismanagement:
Ignoring the 1 000 000 gold cap can lead to inefficient late-game builds.
7. Summary
Warships in OpenFront.io are versatile naval units essential for both offense and defense at sea. By understanding their acquisition costs, combat properties, and strategic roles‚Äîparticularly trade denial and coastal defense‚Äîyou can leverage warships to disrupt opponent economies and secure maritime superiority.

üìÑ FILE: ./openfrontpro.com/buildings/atom-bomb.html
------------------------------------------------------------
OpenFront Pro - Your Ultimate OpenFront.io Companion
Atom Bomb Guide for OpenFront.io
Key Takeaway:
The Atom Bomb is a tactical nuclear weapon ideal for striking concentrated enemy infrastructure. Use it to eliminate clusters of defensive or economic buildings, then follow up with conventional forces to exploit weakened borders.
1. Overview
The Atom Bomb is the smallest-yield nuclear missile in OpenFront.io‚Äôs arsenal. It delivers a powerful fission blast over a limited radius, making it most effective against tightly packed targets such as Cities, Ports, Defense Posts, and Missile Silos.
2. Build Requirements
Prerequisite Building:
Missile Silo
Terrain:
Land only (cannot be built on water)
Availability:
Requires an existing Missile Silo to launch.
3. Core Statistics
Cost:
750,000 Gold
Cooldown:
~10 seconds
Yield Area:
Small radius
Build Category:
[MS] Missile
4. Usage and Tactics
Primary Targets:
Groups of Cities, Ports, Defense Posts, or Enemy Missile Silos positioned closely together.
Tactical Role:
Softening Defenses:
Eliminate or heavily damage clustered defense posts to create exploitable breaches.
Economic Disruption:
Wipe out Port clusters to halt enemy gold flow.
Optimal Timing:
Deploy immediately before an invasion push or to preemptively strike high-value infrastructure ahead of a follow-up land assault.
‚ÄúGenerally you only want to use this to pelt structure-dense areas, such as two adjacent Cities or a Port and Missile Silo.‚Äù
5. Counters and Limitations
Anti-Nuclear Defense:
SAM Launcher:
75% chance to intercept an incoming Atom Bomb; cannot intercept MIRVs.
Resource Intensive:
Requires a fully built Missile Silo (1,000,000 Gold) and carries its own significant cost.
Cooldown Management:
~10 s cooldown restricts rapid successive launches; consider spacing attacks or combining with MIRV for sustained pressure.
6. Advanced Tips
SAM ‚ÄúCooldown Bait‚Äù:
Launch an Atom Bomb first, forcing enemy SAMs onto cooldown, then immediately follow with a Hydrogen Bomb to ensure passage of the larger blast.
Concentration Strikes:
Stack multiple Atom Bombs on a single Missile Silo to unleash rapid successive strikes before the enemy can rebuild defenses.
Diversion & Feint:
Use an Atom Bomb against a low-value cluster to draw SAM fire, then redirect a MIRV at a critical target in a different region.
Mastering the Atom Bomb‚Äôs precise yield and timing will grant you the edge in dismantling enemy infrastructure efficiently and opening borders for your advance.

================================================================================

üìÑ FILE: ./openfrontpro.com/buildings/hydrogen-bomb.html
------------------------------------------------------------
OpenFront Pro - Your Ultimate OpenFront.io Companion
Hydrogen Bomb Guide for OpenFront.io
Main Takeaway:
The Hydrogen Bomb is the most powerful strategic weapon in OpenFront.io, capable of devastating large swaths of territory and manpower. Deploy it via a Missile Silo only in late‚Äìgame scenarios when you have amassed at least 5 000 000 gold and sufficient defenses against enemy SAMs.
1. Overview
The Hydrogen Bomb is a late‚Äìgame
missile
that delivers unparalleled destructive power to a target region. When launched from a Missile Silo, it:
Sustains an aerial flight over long range before impact.
Delivers a
two‚Äêstage blast
: an inner devastation zone and a wider damage perimeter.
Leaves radioactive
fallout
that reduces movement speed and defense of units in affected tiles.
2. Requirements & Deployment
Requirement
Description
Building prerequisite
Missile Silo (must be constructed and cooled down)
Gold cost
5 000 000 gold
Silo cooldown
75 ticks (7.5 seconds)
Tech prerequisites
None beyond silo access
To use:
Build or upgrade a Missile Silo.
Accumulate ‚â• 5 000 000 gold.
Select your target tile within range.
Launch the Hydrogen Bomb.
3. Flight & Interception
Attribute
Value
Maximum range
120 tiles
Flight speed
6 tiles/tick
SAM interception range
80 tiles
SAM hit chance
50% against warheads
Enemy
SAM Missiles
and
SAM Launchers
can intercept your Hydrogen Bomb if positioned within 80 tiles of its path; they have a 50% chance to shoot down the warhead.
4. Blast Characteristics
The explosion comprises two concentric zones:
Zone
Radius (tiles)
Effect
Inner
80
Maximum destruction of units and buildings in zone.
Outer
100
Partial destruction and heavy troop casualties beyond inner radius.
Casualty calculation for humans in affected tiles uses:
$$
\text{troopLossFactor} = \frac{5 \times \text{humans}}{\max(1, \text{tilesOwned})}
$$
This yields severe manpower loss proportional to population density.
5. Fallout Effects
After detonation, all tiles within the
outer radius
become
radioactive
:
Movement penalty:
Units take longer to traverse fallout tiles.
Defense reduction:
Affected tiles suffer a defense modifier of $$5 - 2 \times \text{falloutRatio}$$, where falloutRatio is fraction of map contaminated.
Fallout persists indefinitely, hindering both attacker and defender until remapped.
6. Strategic Usage
Timing:
Deploy only in late game due to high cost and cooldown.
Target selection:
Aim for clusters of enemy SAMs or high-value territories‚Äîe.g., enemy capitals or chokepoints.
Follow-up:
Use conventional troops to occupy fallout zones, leveraging weakened defenses.
Countermeasures:
Enemy SAM coverage or MIRV barrages can thwart your hydrogen strike.

Ports Building Guide for OpenFront.io
What Are Ports?
Ports
are one of the most important economic buildings in OpenFront.io. They are round-shaped, economic buildings that can only be built on land near water. Ports serve as the foundation of your nation‚Äôs naval economy, spawning trade ships and enabling the construction of warships.
Building Requirements and Placement
Placement Requirements
Location
: Ports must be built
near water
Terrain
: Can only be placed on
land tiles
adjacent to water
Building Type
: Classified as an
Economic Building (EB)
with a round shape
Water Access
: Must have access to a water source to function properly
Build Process
To build a port:
Right-click on the map to open the build menu
Select the yellow wrench icon
Choose the port from the economic buildings section
Place it on a land tile that‚Äôs adjacent to water
Cost Structure
Ports use a
doubling cost system
with a maximum cap:
Order
Cost
First Port
125,000 gold
Second Port
250,000 gold
Third Port
500,000 gold
Fourth Port and Beyond
1,000,000 gold
The cost doubles for each port you build until reaching the maximum price of 1,000,000 gold.
Core Functions
Trade Ship Generation
Automatic Spawning
:
Ports check every
10 ticks
if they should spawn a trade ship
Spawn rate formula:
round(10 * Math.pow(numberOfPorts, 0.6))
More ports in the game = higher spawn rates with diminishing returns
Spawn rate is
capped at 50
Trade Ship Characteristics
:
Free to build
and don‚Äôt count against unit limits
Have a bright outline with a dark center appearance
Automatically path to their destination port
Trade Route Selection
Ports follow specific
priority rules
when selecting trade partners:
Only trade with other players
(never with your own ports)
Closer ports
get
double chance
of being selected (proximity bonus)
Allied ports
get
double chance
of being selected
Warship Construction
Ports are
required to build warships
:
Warships can only be built if you own at least one port
When building a warship, it appears at the
nearest owned port
Warships cost: 250k (first), 500k (second), 750k (third), 1M+ (subsequent)
Gold Generation System
Distance-Based Formula
Gold earned from trade is calculated using
Manhattan distance
:
Formula
:
Gold = 10,000 + 150 * Math.pow(distance, 1.1)
Where distance is the sum of absolute differences in X and Y coordinates between ports.
Scaling Examples
Close Trade (20 tiles apart)
:
Base gold: 10,000
Distance bonus: 150 √ó (20^1.1) = 150 √ó 24.53 = 3,680
Total: 13,680 gold each
Long Distance Trade (200 tiles apart)
:
Base gold: 10,000
Distance bonus: 150 √ó (200^1.1) = 150 √ó 316.23 = 47,434
Total: 57,434 gold each
This demonstrates
superlinear scaling
- the 200-tile route is 10x farther but generates 4.2x more gold, making long-distance trade extremely profitable.
Strategic Considerations
Optimal Placement
Spread ports across maximum distances
for higher trade profits
Coastal control
: Secure long coastlines to maximize port placement options
Island hopping
: Establish ports on distant islands for exponential trade gains
River access
: Inland areas with river access can still build ports
Naval Defense
Warship protection
: Build warships to defend trade routes from enemy piracy
Trade interception
: Use warships to capture enemy trade ships
Strategic positioning
: Place ports in defensible locations to prevent enemy capture
Economic Optimization
Trade maximization
: Focus on building ports before other expensive structures
Alliance coordination
: Ally with distant players for maximum trade profit
Port quantity
: More ports = more trade ships = exponential gold growth
Interactions with Other Systems
Naval Combat
Warship spawning
: All warships originate from ports
Trade protection
: Warships can defend trade ships from piracy
Naval supremacy
: Control of ports = control of naval warfare
Alliance Benefits
Allied trading
: Allied ports receive
double selection priority
Trade safety
: Allied warships won‚Äôt capture your trade ships
Mutual benefit
: Both source and destination port owners receive full gold amounts
Defensive Vulnerabilities
High-value targets
: Ports are expensive and attractive targets for nuclear strikes
Coastal exposure
: Ports are vulnerable to naval attacks and amphibious assaults
Economic disruption
: Losing ports severely impacts trade income
Advanced Strategies
Port Maximization
Advanced players often employ ‚Äú
port maxing
‚Äù strategies:
Build as many ports as possible across maximum distances
Prioritize port construction over other buildings
Create extensive trade networks for exponential gold generation
Trade Route Optimization
Distance optimization
: Establish ports at maximum possible distances
Network effects
: More ports create more potential trade routes
Geographic advantage
: Utilize map features like islands and continents for spacing
Naval Empire Building
Maritime focus
: Build naval-centric empires around port control
Trade dominance
: Use superior trade income to fund military expansion
Piracy operations
: Capture enemy trade for additional income
Updated Mechanics
Recent updates have enhanced port functionality:
Betrayal consequences
: Bombing allies stops trading for 5 minutes
Distance calculation
: Gold now calculated by actual ship travel distance rather than straight-line distance
River restrictions
: Warships can‚Äôt target trade ships within rivers
Allied protection
: Warships prevented from pirating trade ships destined for allied ports
Ports represent the cornerstone of economic strategy in OpenFront.io, enabling massive gold generation through trade while providing essential naval capabilities. Mastering port placement, protection, and optimization is crucial for achieving economic dominance and ultimate victory in the game.

------------------------------------------------------------
OpenFront Pro - Your Ultimate OpenFront.io Companion
Cities Building Guide for OpenFront.io
Cities
are the cornerstone building type in OpenFront.io, serving as the primary mechanism for scaling your civilization‚Äôs population capacity and military power. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about building, placing, and strategically utilizing cities to dominate the map.
What Are Cities?
Cities are
Economic Buildings
that appear as round-shaped structures and can only be built on land. They are accessed through the build menu by right-clicking on the map and selecting the yellow wrench icon. Cities serve one fundamental purpose:
increasing your maximum population by exactly 25,000 troops
.
In OpenFront.io‚Äôs current meta, the game is described as ‚Äúreally really city-centric,‚Äù meaning that cities form the foundation of successful strategic gameplay. The difference between players with multiple cities versus those with few cities can determine the outcome of entire matches.
City Costs and Progression
Cities follow a
progressive cost structure
that becomes increasingly expensive with each additional city built:
City Number
Cost
First City
125,000 gold
Second City
250,000 gold
Third City
500,000 gold
Fourth+ Cities
1,000,000 gold each
This escalating cost structure means that early cities provide exceptional value, while later cities require significant gold investment. The dramatic jump from 500,000 to 1,000,000 gold makes the first three cities particularly cost-effective.
Strategic Importance and Timing
Early Game Priority
Cities should be your
top priority
in the early game. As one strategy guide emphasizes: ‚ÄúBuild a city as soon as you reach 125k‚Äù. The reasoning is straightforward‚Äîcities directly translate to military power through increased population capacity.
Professional players consistently demonstrate this principle. In tutorial videos, experienced players are shown ‚Äúputting down cities as quick as they can‚Äù and treating city construction as ‚Äúone of the most important things in Openfront.io right now‚Äù.
Population Mechanics
Understanding population mechanics is crucial for optimal city utilization. OpenFront.io features a
population growth formula
that is optimized when your current population is approximately
41-42% of your maximum population capacity
. This means:
Maintaining around 40-50% population ensures maximum growth rate
Cities increase your capacity, allowing for larger standing armies
Higher population caps provide strategic flexibility for both expansion and defense
The maximum population formula accounts for both land controlled and cities built, with each city contributing exactly 25,000 to the capacity.
City Placement Strategy
Strategic city placement is crucial for long-term success, as poorly placed cities become vulnerable targets that enemies can capture and use against you.
Defensive Positioning
Primary placement guidelines include
:
Place in the most defensible areas
of your territory
Keep cities away from exposed coasts
where naval attacks can threaten them
Avoid placement near navigable rivers
that provide enemy access routes
Keep cities far from other nations
and potential conflict zones
Never place cities on front lines
where they can be easily captured
Terrain Considerations
While the game features three terrain types‚Äî
Plains, Highlands, and Mountains
‚Äîcities can be built on any land terrain. However, placement should prioritize defensibility over terrain bonuses, as losing a city to an enemy provides them with significant strategic advantage.
Multiplayer Considerations
In multiplayer games, city placement becomes even more critical. Players should consider:
Distance from human players
who pose greater threats than AI
Natural barriers
that can protect city locations
Retreat paths
if territories need to be abandoned
Clustering vs. dispersal
strategies based on map layout
Advanced City Strategies
Economic Integration
Cities work synergistically with other economic buildings.
Ports
(which also follow a 125k/250k/500k/1M cost progression) generate trade income that can fund additional city construction. This creates a positive feedback loop where cities enable larger armies that capture more territory, generating more gold for additional cities.
Military Scaling
The 25,000 population increase per city has significant military implications. In a game where ‚Äúif you‚Äôve got a couple extra cities and your neighbor only has like two or three cities, that can make a huge difference,‚Äù this scaling advantage can determine match outcomes.
Upgrade System (Future Updates)
Recent development previews show an upcoming
city upgrade system
. This system will allow players to upgrade existing cities rather than building new ones, with each upgrade adding approximately 25,000 additional population capacity. Upgrades cost 1 million gold each and provide an alternative scaling path for late-game development.
Common Mistakes and Best Practices
Early Game Errors
Delaying first city construction
beyond 125k gold accumulation
Building other structures before securing first city
Poor initial placement
in exposed or vulnerable locations
Strategic Best Practices
Prioritize cities over all other buildings
in early expansion phases
Plan city networks
that can provide mutual defensive support
Consider long-term territorial goals
when placing cities
Balance city investment
with immediate military needs
Advanced Techniques
City clustering
for concentrated defensive power
Strategic spacing
to cover maximum territorial control
Economic timing
to optimize gold flow for continuous city construction
Integration with Overall Strategy
Cities form the foundation of several key strategic elements in OpenFront.io:
Population Management
: Cities enable the optimal 40-50% population ratio that maximizes growth while maintaining offensive capability.
Territorial Control
: Higher population caps allow for larger armies that can capture and hold more territory, creating a positive expansion cycle.
Economic Development
: Cities support the gold generation needed for late-game technologies like missile silos, SAM launchers, and nuclear weapons.
Diplomatic Leverage
: Players with superior city infrastructure can negotiate from positions of strength, as their population advantage translates to military superiority.
Cities represent the most fundamental building type in OpenFront.io, serving as the bedrock upon which all successful strategies are built. Mastering city construction timing, placement, and integration with other game mechanics is essential for achieving territorial domination and victory. The game‚Äôs city-centric design means that players who understand and optimize their city networks will consistently outperform those who neglect this crucial aspect of development.

Missile Behavior & Effects
Flight Path
: Upward toward the map‚Äôs north edge, then lateral dispersal.
Interception
: SAM Launchers cannot destroy MIRVs.
Explosion
: Hundreds of sub-warheads strike randomly, irradiating all impacted land and destroying most defending troops.
Strategic Usage
Offensive
Snowball Prevention
Use MIRV to reset a runaway opponent‚Äôs snowballing territory and troop advantage.
Alliance Disruption
Target key allied nations to fracture coalitions.
Psychological Impact
The threat of MIRV forces opponents to divert resources to missile silos and defense, opening opportunities elsewhere.
Defensive Counterplay
Pre-emptive Strikes
Monitor opponent silo counts; if they approach > 1 silo, consider early aggression.
Border Fortification
Build
Defense Posts
around vulnerable borders to slow re-expansion post-MIRV.
Economic Diversification
Maintain multiple income streams (ports, factories) to rebuild quickly after devastation.
Tips & Best Practices
Silo Clustering
Placing multiple silos close together ensures simultaneous launch if one is destroyed mid-flight.
False Targets
Deploy a visible silo as bait; hide MIRV silos elsewhere to catch enemies off-guard.
Resource Timing
Save up slowly; avoid spending on lower-tier nukes once a MIRV is within reach.
Map Awareness
On large maps, position silos centrally in your territory to minimize enemy shelling and launch delay.
Conclusion
Mastering the MIRV transforms territorial warfare in OpenFront.io. Its unparalleled destructive capability, combined with strategic timing and silo placement, can single-handedly swing the tides of any match. Use it wisely‚Äîboth as a deterrent and a decisive weapon.

Build Limit:
4 posts per game session per player
Territory Risk:
Posts can be captured if an opponent conquers the tile they occupy.
Mechanics and Range
Defense Bonus:
Provides a √ó5 multiplier to the defense of all tiles within range
Terrain Stacking:
Mountains (√ó1.2 terrain modifier): yields a √ó6 total defense bonus
Plains (√ó0.9 terrain modifier): yields a √ó4.5 total defense bonus
Highlands (√ó1.0 terrain modifier): remains √ó5 total defense bonus
Range:
Official wiki: 30 tiles using Manhattan distance (diamond-shaped area)
Attacking guide (v23): 40 tiles using Euclidean distance (circular area)
Stacking Rules:
Multiple Defense Posts do
not
stack; only the nearest post applies its bonus to a given tile.
Effects on Combat
When an enemy attempts to conquer a tile within a Defense Post‚Äôs range:
Attacker Losses Multiplied:
√ó6 (i.e., +500% casualties)
Attack Speed Reduced:
‚àí66% processing rate
Sustained Attrition:
Attacker loses double the troops per unit time while within range
Single-Post Cap:
Only the strongest applicable post affects attacks on any tile.
Strategic Placement
Vulnerable Borders:
Position posts just inside your frontline to protect high-value cities and chokepoints.
Terrain Advantage:
Place posts in mountainous areas to maximize the defense bonus (√ó6).
Choke Points & Passes:
Cover narrow land bridges or mountain passes where attackers must funnel through.
City Protection:
Surround key cities‚Äîloss of border tiles can cascade into city capture.
Counterplay and Limitations
Flanking & Sea Routes:
Attackers can bypass posts via naval invasions if unprotected at sea.
Range Exploitation:
Engage outside the post‚Äôs effective radius and then dash in to capture critical tiles before reinforcements arrive.
Economic Pressure:
Repeatedly building and replacing Defense Posts can drain gold reserves‚Äîcoordinate defense with allies to share the burden.
Advanced Tips
Beginners should avoid early-game overinvestment in Defense Posts; focus on territorial expansion first.
Experienced players often delay post construction until natural borders solidify, then reinforce selectively.
Combine Defense Posts with terrain modifiers and allied buffer zones for layered defense.
Monitor enemy troop compositions‚Äîhigh-volume assaults can still overwhelm static defenses if unsupported by counterattacks.
With precise placement and timing, Defense Posts become force multipliers that shape the flow of conquest across the map.

Missile Silo Guide for OpenFront.io
Main Takeaway:
The Missile Silo is a late-game military building that unlocks strategic nuclear strikes. Proper placement, timing, and coordination with defenses (SAM Launchers and Defense Posts) are essential to maximize its impact.
1. Overview
The
Missile Silo
is a military building priced at
1,000,000 gold
. It serves exclusively to launch three types of strategic missiles:
Atom Bomb
: Small blast radius
Hydrogen Bomb
: Large blast radius
MIRV
: Multiple mini-warheads across a nation
[Fact Source: OpenFront Miraheze Wiki]
2. Construction Requirements
Terrain: Land only

page of the OpenFront Miraheze Wiki.
4. Usage & Mechanics
Targeting:
Right-click on enemy territory pixel ‚Üí building menu ‚Üí select missile type.
The nearest available Missile Silo will launch the strike.
Reload Indicator:
After firing, the silo flashes
red
for 8 seconds, indicating it is
reloading
and cannot fire again until this period ends.
Defensive Countermeasures:
SAM Launchers
(Surface-to-Air Missile) have a
75%
chance to intercept Atom or Hydrogen Bombs within a 75-pixel radius; they cannot destroy MIRVs.
Best practice: Surround high-value silos and cities with a network of SAMs and Defense Posts.
‚ÄúWhen a Missile Silo just launched a missile, it becomes red for 8 seconds‚Ä¶cannot be used.‚Äù (Missile Silo ‚Äì OpenFront Miraheze Wiki)
5. Strategic Considerations
Timing:
Use nuclear strikes to soften hardened defenses or disrupt enemy gold production by targeting Ports and Cities.
Psychological Impact:
A well-timed Hydrogen Bomb can break alliances or force opponents into reactive play.
Synergy:
Complement nuclear strikes with ground invasions; use Defense Posts to hold newly vacated pixels.
Resource Management:
Nuclear missiles are expensive; balance investment in silos versus conventional buildings like Cities (more population) and Ports (steady gold income).
6. Example Build Order (Mid-Late Game)
Establish
3‚Äì4 Cities
for population buffer.
Build
2‚Äì3 Ports
to sustain gold flow (125k ‚Üí 250k ‚Üí 500k).
Deploy
2‚Äì3 SAM Launchers
around forward borders.
Construct
1‚Äì2 Missile Silos
in safe, inland pixels.
Add
Defense Posts
along borders to deter incursions.
Begin nuclear strikes once you have 1‚Äì2M+ gold reserves.
7. Advanced Tips
Feint Attacks:
Launch Atom Bomb on minor targets to bait enemy SAM usage before a major Hydrogen Bomb strike.
MIRV Barrage:
Use a MIRV to saturate SAM coverage‚Äîa single MIRV can overwhelm multiple SAMs.
Silhouette Management:
Keep silos grouped but not adjacent; prevents a single enemy strike from disabling all launchers.
Cooldown Cycling:
Stagger silo reloads by launching at slightly different times, ensuring continuous nuclear availability.
With precise execution, Missile Silos transform the battlefield in OpenFront.io‚Äîuse them wisely to dominate mid-to-late game engagements.

Enclosure (Annexation) Guide for OpenFront.io
Main Takeaway:
Enclosure‚Äîalso known as
annexation
‚Äîallows you to capture entire territories by fully surrounding them, bypassing protracted battles. Mastering enclosure accelerates expansion, conserves troops, and can swing the tide in your favor early and mid-game.
1. What Is Enclosure?
Enclosure occurs when you
completely encircle
an adjacent territory (bot or player) so that it has no open border connections. Once surrounded, the territory is instantly annexed‚Äîall its land transfers to you without further combat.
2. Why Use Enclosure?
Troop Efficiency:
Annexation uses only the initial attacking stacks, with no additional losses afterward.
Speed:
Instant capture skips multi‚Äêround exchanges.
Map Control:
Rapidly grows your land and resource generation.
Psychological Impact:
Surprising an opponent with enclosure can force them into defensive play.
3. How to Execute Enclosure
3.1. Preparation
Build Population:
‚Äì Raise your population to ‚âà 40 ‚Äì 50% of cap to maximize growth rate (peak at ~41%).
Scout Terrain:
‚Äì Press
Spacebar
to reveal terrain and neighboring territories; identify narrow fronts or chokepoints.
3.2. Choosing the Target
‚Äì
Bots First:
Ideal initial targets due to predictable, static borders.
‚Äì
Real Players:
Wait until they‚Äôre engaged elsewhere or have stretched borders.
3.3. Calculating Attack Size
‚Äì
Optimal Percentage:
40 ‚Äì 50% of your troops balances speed and losses; higher percentages move faster and suffer fewer casualties.
‚Äì
Attack Ratio Adjustment:
In the attack panel, adjust your troops-to-worker ratio to maximize movement speed without crippling your economy.
3.4. Executing the Enclosure
Multi-Front Push:
Simultaneously attack from all bordering sides of the target territory.
Timing:
Coordinate so all attacks land within the same tick, closing gaps instantly.
Split Attacks:
If terrain forces asymmetrical fronts, use smaller attacks on narrow sides to seal off escape routes.
4. Advanced Enclosure Tactics
Tactic
Description
Choke-Point Enclosure
Use rivers, mountains, or coasts to reduce the number of fronts you must attack, sealing the territory more efficiently.
Feint and Seal
Send a small force as a
feint
on one side, drawing defenders, then launch your main enclosure force on the opposite front.
Ally Buffer
Form temporary alliances to occupy adjacent territories, preventing opponents from reinforcing the target you intend to enclose.
Follow-Up Infrastructure Push
After enclosure, immediately plant
cities
on newly acquired borders to raise your population cap and prepare for the next push.
5. Defending Against Enclosure
Maintain Open Exits:
Always leave at least one border connection to a friendly or neutral territory.
Defense Posts & SAMs:
Defense Posts
quintuple the cost of conquest around them‚Äîuse them to protect chokepoints.
SAM Launchers
cannot prevent annexations but deter aerial bombardments during multi-front attacks.
Alliances & Betrayals:
Do
not
accept alliance requests from neighbors you suspect aim to enclose you‚Äîthey gain a +50% casualty penalty on betrayal, leaving you vulnerable if you refuse.
6. Common Pitfalls
Oversized Attacks:
Deploying > 60% of your troops slows movement drastically; use moderate percentages.
Poor Timing:
Staggered attack arrivals leave gaps for defenders to reinforce or counterattack.
Ignoring Economy:
Draining troops for enclosure can cripple gold income if your worker ratio falls too low.

Expanding Effectively in OpenFront.io
Key Takeaway:
Success in OpenFront.io hinges on
balanced expansion
, combining rapid territorial growth with strategic consolidation‚Äîoptimizing your population growth rate at ~42%, leveraging annexations, and fortifying key borders with cities and defense posts.
1. Fundamentals of Expansion
1.1 Territory and Population
Tiles Owned:
Each tile you control increases your maximum population cap.
Cities:
Upgrading and building cities adds +25,000 troop capacity per level.
Population Growth Curve:
Growth per tick follows a bell curve optimized when current population ‚âà42% of max.
1.2 Workers vs. Troops
Workers
grow your population ~30% faster and generate gold but cannot defend.
Troops
defend and conquer but slow growth when committed.
Optimal Split:
Beginners should start at ~50% workers; adjust toward 60‚Äì70% workers as you master timing.
2. Early-Game Expansion (‚ÄúWildlands Phase‚Äù)
2.1 Targeting Bots
Focus on
small, isolated bots
first to maximize annexation opportunities and snowball early troops.
Annexation Rule:
Surround bot territories fully (no tile touching water/map edge) to instantly absorb them.
2.2 Timing Attacks
Commit ~50% of your current max population to initial attacks to stay near the 42% growth sweet spot.
Pause expansion briefly after capturing wildlands to build workers and cities before pushing deeper.
3. Mid-Game Consolidation
3.1 City Placement
Place cities on high-traffic borders to boost cap where you need defense most.
Balance city levels‚Äîhigher levels yield more capacity but cost exponentially more gold.
3.2 Defense Posts
Build defense posts covering chokepoints; range = 40 tiles (Euclidean).
Within a post‚Äôs range, attackers suffer √ó6 troop loss and ‚Äì66% attack speed.
3.3 Trade and Naval Control
Construct ports on coasts to start trade routes‚Äîgold income helps fund cities and nukes.
Use warships to intercept enemy trade ships and deny rivals economy.
4. Late-Game Domination
4.1 Nukes and Bombs
Hydrogen bombs (large radius) destabilize opponent population clusters.
MIRV nukes target specific enemy players for surgical strikes.
4.2 Alliance Management
Maintain alliances to secure flanks; betraying allies flags you as a traitor, giving attackers ‚Äì50% losses when they strike you for 30 s.
Time betrayals just before a major push to avoid traitor penalty during your offensive.
4.3 Final Push
Consolidate all free tiles under your flag; only then surge troop percentage to >80% for a sweeping final conquest.
Coordinate naval and land attacks to overwhelm defenders.
By mastering the
42% population growth optimum
, judicious
annexations
, and strategic use of
defensive structures
, players can expand efficiently while sustaining robust economies and defensive capabilities.

OpenFront.io Winning Guide
Main Takeaway:
Mastering OpenFront.io requires
phase-specific strategies
‚Äîfrom securing an optimal start and efficient early expansion to leveraging alliances and infrastructure in the midgame, and executing precise nuclear and naval operations in the endgame.
1. Introduction
OpenFront.io is a browser-based real-time strategy game focused on territorial control, resource management, and strategic alliances. Victory is achieved by capturing 100% of the map (or 72% in shorter matches) or reducing all opponents to 0% territory.
2. Early Game Strategy
2.1 Starting Position
Choose low-density regions
with ample grasslands: corners and edges reduce early threats, while central spots offer expansion via alliances.
Prioritize proximity to unoccupied lands for swift annexation.
2.2 Opening Moves
Balance expansion with population growth.
Aim to keep current manpower between 30‚Äì50% of cap for fastest recovery; push to ~75% only when planning a major blitzkrieg.
Annex bots via encirclement:
Surrounding a bot territory causes instant surrender (‚ÄúThanos snap‚Äù). Smaller bots should be targeted first to maximize efficiency and gold gain.
2.3 Building Infrastructure
Cities
increase population cap by +25 000 each‚Äîbuild them early to sustain large armies.
Ports
unlock naval units and trade routes; place them before midgame to boost gold income.
Defense posts
(range 40 tiles) deter enemy attacks: they multiply attacker losses by 6√ó and slow attack speed by 66% when within range.
3. Midgame Strategy
3.1 Population and Attack Ratios
Adjust the
red bar
(attack ratio) and
blue bar
(troop vs. worker split) to maintain a growth-efficient bell curve: maximum troop generation occurs around 50% population cap.
3.2 Alliance and Diplomacy
Peace treaties
secure borders and enable trade.
Forge alliances with human players and NPCs to focus on common enemies and share trade benefits.
3.3 Naval Dominance
Warships
control sea lanes and enable island assaults.
Prioritize the first few ports and a minimal fleet to deny opponents maritime mobility.
3.4 Staggered Attacks
Staggering attacks around your population peak prevents downtime in manpower recovery, maintaining offensive pressure without crippling your growth.
4. Late Game & Endgame
4.1 Nuclear Warfare
MIRV
(nuclear strikes) can eliminate up to 99% of an opponent‚Äôs troops and territory.
Deploy
SAM bunkers
in late game to intercept incoming nukes; staggering their cooldowns ensures continuous coverage.
4.2 Final Push
Avoid overextension; focus on targets that yield annexations or cripple rivals‚Äô key infrastructure.
Let opponents weaken each other with nuclear exchanges, then strike the survivor for the final 80‚Äì100% win condition.
5. Advanced Tips
Tip
Effectiveness
Encircle bots
Instant bot surrender; rapid land gain
Early city rush
Boosts population cap; enables sustained military production
Stagger SAM cooldowns
Continuous nuclear defense; prevents surprise mass nukes
Use defense posts at chokepoints
Maximizes defensive multiplier; deters frontal attacks
Adjust attack ratio dynamically
Maintains optimal manpower growth; prevents recovery lulls
Prioritize ports near contested zones
Secures trade; provides naval mobility and surprise coastal strikes
6. Conclusion
By tailoring your play to the three core phases‚Äî
early expansion
,
midgame infrastructure and alliances
, and
endgame nuclear/naval warfare
‚Äîyou can consistently achieve victories in OpenFront.io. Meticulous resource balancing, geographical awareness, and tactical use of infrastructure and nukes separate champions from novices. Good luck on the battlefield!

Guide to Alliances in OpenFront.io
Alliances in OpenFront.io are a powerful diplomatic tool that can secure your borders, boost your economy, and shape the balance of power on any map. This guide covers everything you need to know‚Äîmechanics, strategy, etiquette, and common pitfalls‚Äîso you can form and leverage alliances effectively.
1. Alliance Basics
1.1 Forming and Breaking Alliances
In
Free for All
mode:
Right-click a player‚Äôs territory and select the handshake icon to
offer an alliance
.
If accepted, you become allies immediately.
In
Teams
mode:
You are automatically allied with players of your color and cannot betray teammates.
An alliance
lasts 10 minutes
and can be renewed by mutual agreement.
1.2 Effects of Alliances
Being allied confers several benefits:
Priority trade
: Trade ships favor allied ports.
Friendly fire disabled
: Ground and naval units ignore allied territory.
No sea capture
: Your warships will not seize allied trade ships.
Reinforcements
: You can send troops or gold directly to an ally.
Breaking an alliance triggers
Traitor
status for 30 seconds:
50% defense penalty for the betrayer.
Automatic embargo on trade until manually lifted or alliance restored.
Traitor count increases.
2. Strategic Considerations
2.1 Choosing Allies
Assess power balance
: Ally stronger neighbors to deter aggression, or weaker ones to expand influence.
Terrain synergy
: On chokepoint maps, ally players who cover vulnerable flanks, e.g., mountainous borders.
Trade networks
: Secure allies with strong naval presence to maximize gold flow via ports.
2.2 Timing and Renewal
Early game
: Form quick non-aggression pacts to focus on snowballing land captures.
Mid-game
: Renew alliances before the 10-minute timer elapses; track durations on the info bar.
Endgame
: Use alliance windows to coordinate mass assaults or safe annexations.
2.3 Coordinated Offense and Defense
Joint attacks
: Synchronize troop donations and defense posts to bolster a shared border.
Defense posts
: Place posts on border segments vulnerable to allied aggression to dissuade betrayal.
Troop donations
: Send reinforcements to allies under heavy attack to maintain mutual strength.
3. Etiquette and Common Pitfalls
3.1 Betrayal Tactics
A known exploit is
attacking an offeror
for a border strip, then accepting the alliance to retain the gains. This can be countered by:
Waiting to accept alliances until after the attacker‚Äôs troops withdraw.
Observing troop movements: do not accept while under attack.
3.2 Trust and Reputation
Frequent betrayals mark you as untrustworthy; allies may refuse future offers.
Use public chat or voice channels to build credibility and coordinate reliably.
4. Advanced Tips
Tip
Benefit
Send 1% naval probes post-alliance
Test allied warship placements and reveal vulnerabilities.
Stack ports with allies
Create a joint trade corridor to starve enemies of gold.
Rotate alliance partners
Maintain fresh diplomatic ties to prevent collusion against you.
5. Summary
Alliances in OpenFront.io are
temporary but potent
. Use them to secure borders, share resources, and execute coordinated strategies. Always monitor alliance timers, communicate intentions, and guard against betrayal tactics to make the most of every handshake.
Enjoy forging‚Äîand sometimes breaking‚Äîalliances to dominate your next match!

üìÑ FILE: ./openfrontpro.com/mechanics/population-growth.html
------------------------------------------------------------
OpenFront Pro - Your Ultimate OpenFront.io Companion
Population Growth Guide for OpenFront.io
Key Takeaway:
To maximize population growth in OpenFront.io, manage your
maximum population cap
via territory and cities, maintain your
current population
at the
optimal growth ratio
(‚âà 40‚Äì50% of cap), and balance
workers vs. troops
allocation for both economic gain and defense.
1. Maximum Population Cap
Your
maximum population cap
determines the upper limit of combined workers and troops you can sustain. Two primary factors affect it:
Tiles Owned
Each tile under your control contributes to your cap. Expanding territory early increases your cap, enabling higher growth potential.
Cities
Building a City structure adds
+25,000
to your cap per level:
City Level
Added Cap
Cost
First
25,000
125,000 G
Second
25,000
250,000 G
Third
25,000
500,000 G
Beyond Third
25,000
1,000,000 G
Each subsequent city level costs roughly double the previous.
2. Population Growth Curve
Population growth per tick follows a
bell-curve function
based on the ratio $$r$$ of
current population
to
max cap
. Growth is maximized at approximately
41% of cap
in current versions (v23) and recently shifted to
50%
in newer updates.
When $$r < r_\text{optimal}$$, growth rate (green indicator) increases as $$r$$ approaches $$r_\text{optimal}$$.
When $$r > r_\text{optimal}$$, growth rate (yellow/orange indicator) decreases.
Practical Guideline:
Aim to keep your population between
35%‚Äì55%
of cap, ideally cycling close to the
40‚Äì50%
sweet spot during peacetime for fastest recovery.
3. Workers vs. Troops
Population divides into:
Workers
Generate gold over time.
Reproduce ~30% faster than troops.
Contribute fully to growth curve when idle.
Troops
Provide defense and offensive power.
Do
not
grow while committed to attacks or stationed as defense posts.
Subtract from the idle population pool, reducing growth rate.
Strategic Balance:
Early game:
‚âà 50%
of idle pop as workers to accelerate cap and gold.
Mid to late game: Adjust to
30‚Äì40%
workers when defensive pressure rises, ensuring enough troops while sustaining growth.
4. Attack Ratio and Growth Impact
The
attack ratio
slider determines what fraction of your population is sent in assaults. Note:
High attack ratio (> 80%)
severely reduces idle pop, hindering growth until recovery.
Low attack ratio (< 20%)
underutilizes troops, missing expansion opportunities.
Recommendation:
Maintain attack ratios of
20‚Äì50%
, scheduling assaults when your population is in the
green growth zone
to minimize recovery downtime.
5. Practical Tips
Early Expansion:
Capture unclaimed tiles to boost cap.
Build first Cities only after securing territory.
Cap Management:
Monitor cap vs. pop gauge; avoid hitting cap (growth stalls).
Plan City builds when approaching cap.
Dynamic Allocation:
Increase worker percentage when idle and in low-risk phases.
Shift to troop-heavy allocations before major battles.
Use Growth Indicator:
Green
= growth accelerating; ideal time to hold or build Cities.
Yellow/Red
= growth slowing; avoid large attacks until back in green.
Leverage Defense Posts:
Fortify borders using Defense Posts (strength √ó5) to protect idle pop and maintain growth base.
By combining
territorial expansion
,
City construction
, and
optimal idle population ratios
, you can sustain rapid population growth, generate gold efficiently, and maintain military readiness‚Äîkey components for victory in OpenFront.io.

OpenFront.io Bots Guide
Overview
In OpenFront.io,
bots
are non-player countries used to fill the map, slowing player expansion and creating dynamic encounters. Every public game spawns 400 bots by default, each with unique two-word names and no custom flags. Bots never build cities or ships‚Äîthey only expand by sending small, steady attacks into neighboring tiles.
Bot Behavior
Static Spawn
Bots appear at random locations, evenly spaced, before the game begins.
They never relocate once placed.
Expansion
Bots send minimal-sized attacks (often 1 ‚Äì 5% of their population) at adjacent neutral tiles.
They never construct buildings or transport units; any city or port they possess was conquered from another country.
Aggression Level
Predictable and low: players rarely need to fear a sudden large-scale bot offensive‚Äîunless they ‚Äúfull-send‚Äù into a bot and allow it to rebuild behind them.
Game Modes & Bot Settings
Public Multiplayer
400 bots fixed; players compete for land and gold against both human opponents and bots.
Single Player
Default bot count is 400; adjustable via slider in the lobby.
Reducing bots speeds up expansion; setting to zero removes bots entirely, leaving only nations and human players.
Bot Difficulty Variants
Normal Bots
Standard behavior as above.
Impossible Bots
Enhanced starting populations (e.g., 100 K troops) and faster expansion rates.
Treat as human-level opponents: prioritize early city building and tactical encirclement to contain them.
Counter-Bot Strategies
Strategy
Early Game (Tiles < 50)
Mid/Late Game (Tiles > 50)
Attack Ratio
50% of max troops
20% of max troops
Worker Percentage
~50% to balance growth & offense
Increase only if secure front
Encirclement
Surround isolated bots to prevent reinforcement
Link encircled bots with cities/ports to starve their gold income
Port Priority
Build 1st port after second city
Maintain ports on bot-heavy coasts
City Placement
Build on neutral gold tiles early
Upgrade existing cities to boost population cap
50% Attack Push
Using half your troops maximizes territory gain while preserving population growth, crucial when bots pack lightly defended tiles.
20% Follow-Up
After initial expansion, switch to 20% attacks to steadily grind down bot holdings without overextending.
Encircle & Starve
Quickly circle a bot‚Äôs territory, then build a city or port on the encirclement line. This cuts off its gold and reinforcements, making it trivial to mop up later.
Prioritize Cities
Early cities raise the population cap, fueling future attacks. Aim for at least two cities before aggressive pushes into Impossible Bot zones.
Port Control
On maps with water, securing a port grants sea lanes for surprise attacks on bot-isolated islands or coasts.
Advanced Tips
Bot Name Recognition
Bots use two random words (e.g., ‚ÄúBlue Tiger‚Äù); no custom flags‚Äîidentifying them by flag absence helps target weaker foes.
Difficulty Correlation
In single-player, increasing difficulty may subtly boost bot aggression or initial populations, though exact modifiers are undocumented.
Tradeoffs
Removing bots entirely speeds games but eliminates early-game resistance and gold sources from bot-conquered ports.
Adhering to these tactics will render bots predictable obstacles rather than frustrating roadblocks. Mastering the
50%/20% attack rhythm
,
encirclement
, and
city-port
prioritization turns every bot-filled map into an opportunity for rapid, controlled expansion.

: 125 000 gold; each subsequent Port doubles in cost until reaching 1 000 000 gold.
Ports enable:
Automatic spawning of Trade Ships
Construction of Warships (Destroyers and Battleships)
2. Trade Ship Spawning and Routing
Every 10 ticks, each Port attempts to spawn a Trade Ship, with spawn rate
tradeShipSpawnRate = round(10 √ó (numberOfPorts)^0.6)
(diminishing returns cap spawn rate at 50).
Trade partners are selected among other players‚Äô Ports, prioritized by:
Alliance status
: allied Ports have double chance
Proximity
: closer Ports have double chance
Trade Ships travel automatically along the shortest path to their destination Port.
3. Gold Generation and Scaling
Upon arrival, each Trade Ship grants gold to both origin and destination owners:
Gold = 10 000 + 150 √ó (distance^1.1)
(distance measured by Manhattan metric)
Short route example (20 tiles)
: 10 000 + 150 √ó 20^1.1 ‚âà 13 680 gold
Long route example (200 tiles)
: 10 000 + 150 √ó 200^1.1 ‚âà 57 434 gold
Longer routes yield
superlinear
returns, incentivizing distant alliances.
Route Length
Gold per Ship
20 tiles
13 680

4. Protecting and Pirating Trade Ships
Safe zones
: within a few tiles of any shoreline, Trade Ships become ‚Äúsafe from pirates,‚Äù immune to capture.
Piracy
: outside safe zones, enemy Destroyers can capture Trade Ships.
Captor receives full gold bounty
Ship re-routes to captor‚Äôs nearest Port (or removed if none exist)
5. Warships for Trade Control
Destroyers
: fast, used to intercept and capture enemy Trade Ships.
Battleships
: slow but ranged, effective at protecting your Trade Ships and deterring enemy Destroyers.
Use a combination of both to secure your trade lanes and cut off opponents‚Äô income.
6. Strategic Recommendations
Early Port priority
: aim for your first Port as soon as you have ~125 000 gold to kickstart trade income.
Long-distance alliances
: ally with distant players to maximize route length and gold yield.
Naval presence
: station a mix of Destroyers and Battleships along key routes to both protect your Trade Ships and harass opponents.
Port placement
: build Ports on map chokepoints or near friendly shores to increase piracy protection.
Port count vs. cost
: balance spawning rate benefits against exponentially rising Port costs; generally, 2‚Äì4 well-placed Ports outperform many high-cost Ports.
By leveraging these mechanics‚Äîefficient Port building, strategic alliances, and naval warfare‚Äîyou can turn trade into a decisive economic engine and outpace rivals in OpenFront.io.

Attack Ratio Guide for OpenFront.io
Main Recommendation:
To balance rapid expansion with sustainable growth, use an attack ratio of
50%
during early bot engagements and transition to
20‚Äì30%
against human players and fortified opponents.
1. Understanding Attack Ratio
The
attack ratio
determines what fraction of your available troops you commit when initiating an attack.
A 1% ratio sends 1% of your troops; a 100% ratio sends your entire force.
Adjust the ratio via the slider (Shift + Scroll Wheel) or hotkeys (
1
to decrease,
2
to increase) .
2. Impact on Combat Speed
Attack speed (tiles conquered per tick) scales with the attacker-to-defender size ratio:
For every 1% increase in attacker size (relative to defender troops), speed increases by:
0.5% per 1%
ratio increase when attacker force is between 5% and 10√ó the defender‚Äôs size
0.1% per 1%
ratio increase when attacker exceeds 10√ó defender size
No speed bonus if attacker is smaller than 5% of defender troops
(speed is also modified by terrain and empire size) .
3. Impact on Troop Losses
Troop losses per tick are governed by the
Troop Ratio Factor
, terrain, and a fixed 20% attacker bonus:
Troop Ratio Factor
= max(min(defender_troops / attacking_troops, 2), 0.6)
Attacking with less than half defender troops ‚Üí factor hits
2√ó
(higher losses)
Attacking with ‚â•166% of defender troops ‚Üí factor hits
0.6√ó
(minimum losses)
Attacker Troop Loss
= Troop Ratio Factor √ó Terrain Multiplier √ó 0.8 (attacker bonus) √ó Size Penalty √ó Traitor Penalty .
To minimize losses, ensure your committed troops ‚â•166% of defender troops (ratio ‚âà 1.66).
4. Speed vs. Efficiency Trade-Off
High attack ratios yield faster conquests but can deplete your shield (defending garrison) and slow population growth. Lower ratios conserve troops and shield but slow expansion.
Attack Ratio
Speed Bonus
Loss Efficiency
Recommended Use
50%
Moderate (+25%)
Acceptable (Troop Ratio Factor‚âà1‚Äì1.2√ó)
Early bot farming; balance growth vs. speed
20‚Äì30%
Small (+10‚Äì15%)
Efficient (minimize shield loss)
Mid-game human engagements; node skirmishes
‚â•166%
Max
(+83%‚Äì100%)
Minimum losses
(0.6√ó factor)
Quick snipes on key targets; decisive strikes
5. Terrain & Empire Size Modifiers
Terrain Multipliers
Plains: ‚Äì15% troop losses, +10% speed
Highlands: baseline
Mountains: +20% troop losses, ‚Äì25% speed
Size Penalty
Empires >100 000 tiles gain ‚àö(100 000 / tiles) reduction in losses
Empires >75 000 tiles incur slower conquest speed via (75 000 / tiles)^0.6 .
6. Practical Recommendations
Early Expansion (Bots & Wilderness)
Use
50% ratio
against bots to farm quickly while retaining growth.
Exploit wilderness with high ratios for rapid tile gains (no defender losses) [Combat Against Wilderness].
Mid-Game Engagements
Lower ratio to
20‚Äì30%
when contesting human players or strong bots to preserve shield and growth.
Decisive Strikes
Commit ‚â•166% ratio to
snipe
high-value enemy cities or break alliances swiftly with minimum losses.
Dynamic Adjustment
Monitor population growth bell curve (~42% of max pop) and adjust worker vs. troop ratios accordingly.
Rebalance attack ratio as your empire and frontline change.
7. Control Shortcuts
Shift + Scroll Wheel
: Fine-tune attack ratio
1 / 2
: Decrease / Increase ratio in preset steps
Left Click
: Attack with current ratio

OpenFront Pro - Your Ultimate OpenFront.io Companion
Guide to Choosing the Best Starting Position in OpenFront.io
The choice of starting position in OpenFront.io can
make or break
your early-game snowball. Selecting terrain that maximizes your expansion potential while minimizing early threats will set the stage for a dominant performance. This guide covers the fundamental factors to consider and presents recommended spawn types, illustrated with examples.
Key Factors in Spawn Selection
Terrain Type
Plains (Grasslands):
Lowest capture cost. Ideal for rapid expansion and population growth.
Highlands (Hills):
Moderate cost; use only if plains are unavailable.
Mountains:
Highest cost; generally
avoid
as a primary spawn unless you seek defensive advantage at the expense of growth.
Proximity to Other Players
Far from Opponents:
Reduces early PvP skirmishes, allowing you to focus on PvE against bots.
Too Isolated:
May limit immediate unoccupied lands and bot targets.
Map Location
Corners & Edges:
Advantages:
One fewer flank to defend.
Trade-off:
Fewer adjacent unoccupied tiles, slowing expansion.
Center:
Advantages:
Maximum access to unoccupied lands and bots in multiple directions.
Trade-off:
Surrounded on all sides; requires alliances or rapid blitz.
Bot Tier Proximity
Bots spawn in two tiers:
Lower-tier bots
have less starting manpower; prioritize encircling them.
Higher-tier bots
cost more to conquer later; deprioritize until you have surplus manpower.
Recommended Spawn Categories
Spawn Type
Terrain Preference
Threat Profile
Expansion Rate
Strategy
Plains Corner
Plains
Low
Moderate
Secure bots on two sides; turtle with defense posts then expand along border.
Plains Edge
Plains
Moderate
High
Capture adjacent bots quickly; use edge as natural barrier.
Plains Center
Plains
High
Very High
Blitz multiple bots; form alliances to mitigate multi-front pressure.
Highland Edge
Highlands
Moderate
Moderate
Accept slightly higher cost for added natural defense.
Mountain Corner
Mountains
Very Low
Slow
Defensive opening; build up population behind fortifications.
Spawn Selection Checklist
Scan for Plains
within your view before clicking.
Identify Nearby Bots:
Prioritize clusters of low-tier bots you can encircle.
Assess Player Density:
Choose a gap between other players wherever possible.
Decide Flank Configuration:
Corner if you value safety.
Center if you value rapid growth and can secure alliances.
Finalize Spawn:
Click to lock in once conditions match your preferred profile.
Execution After Spawning
Opening Expansion
Maintain manpower at 30‚Äì50% of cap for optimal growth; surge to ~75% when preparing a blitz.
Expand into unoccupied plains immediately.
Rushing Bots
Wait for sufficient manpower to avoid penalties from under-strength pushes.
Simultaneously attack multiple bots when possible.
Encircled bots surrender instantly‚Äîaim to cut off their only escape route.
Transition to Mid Game
Once bots are cleared, pivot to PvP or secure trade routes via ports.
Build cities to raise population cap and defense posts on vulnerable borders.
Choosing the right starting position
‚Äîcombining terrain, map location, and bot proximity‚Äî
enables a powerful early-game snowball
. Use corners and edges for safer, steadier growth, or center positions for explosive expansion when you can manage multiple fronts.

OpenFront.io Defense Guide
Main Takeaway:
Effective defense in OpenFront.io hinges on leveraging terrain advantages, judicious placement of Defense Posts, and integrating supportive structures (SAM Launchers, Missile Silos) into a cohesive border-fortification strategy.
1. Defense Fundamentals
OpenFront‚Äôs combat mechanics inherently favor defenders:
Defender Loss Formula:
$$ \text{Defender Loss/tick} = \frac{\text{Defender Troops}}{\text{Tiles Owned}} $$
Attacker Loss Formula:
$$ \text{Attacker Loss/tick} = \text{Troop Ratio Factor} \times \text{Terrain Multiplier} \times 0.8 \times \text{Size Modifier} \times (\text{Traitor? }0.5:1) $$
Key Implication:
Attacks against small empires incur high ratio losses; defenders on few tiles take heavier losses per tile than large empires.
Press Spacebar to overlay terrain.
Terrain confers multipliers:
Plains: 0.85√ó losses, +17.5% speed
Highlands: 1.00√ó losses, base speed
Mountains: 1.20√ó losses, ‚Äì25% speed
2. Terrain-Driven Defense
Hold High Ground:
Station troops on mountains or highlands to increase attacker losses by up to 20% and slow their conquest.
Choke Points:
Use narrow passages (e.g., mountain gaps) to funnel attacks into kill zones.
Wilderness as Buffer:
Expand into unclaimed land early to create a safe perimeter; attacker losses on wilderness are fixed by terrain without base reduction (20‚Äì24 troops/tick).
3. Defense Posts**
Building Stats
Cost: 50 000 ‚Üí +50 000 (max 250 000)
Build time: 5 s (50 ticks)
Range: 30 tiles (diamond shape, Manhattan distance)
Stacks with terrain:
Mountains: 6√ó total defense
Highlands: 5√ó
Plains: 4.5√ó
Multiple posts do
not
stack
Best Practices
Key Borders:
Place posts at vulnerable frontiers with enemy adjacency.
Terrain Synergy:
Build in mountains to maximize 6√ó defense.
Depth Layering:
Stagger posts ~30 tiles apart to cover successive border rings.
Economy vs. Defense:
Early game posts offer diminishing returns; prioritize when under direct threat.
4. Anti-Missile Layer**
SAM Launcher:
Destroys 75% of incoming Atom/Hydrogen bombs; cooldown 7.5 s; cannot intercept MIRVs.
Missile Silo:
Enables your own nukes; place safely behind Defense Posts to deter ‚Äúnuke rush‚Äù.
SAM Net Strategy:
Arrange SAMs in a web covering high-value cities and silos. Late-game ‚ÄúSAM nets‚Äù around island clusters or peninsulas make MIRV strikes prohibitively costly for attackers.
5. Dynamic Border Management
Troop Reserves:
Keep a mobile reserve behind posts to reinforce breached tiles.
Traitormeter Awareness:
Betrayed allies suffer 50% increased attacker losses for 30 s; use non-aggression pacts to safely reinforce borders and avoid ‚Äútraitor‚Äù debuffs.
Alliances & Betrayal:
Defensive pacts can free resources for other fronts; timing betrayals to coincide with major engagements maximizes defense.
6. Early-Game Turtle & Expansion
Annexations:
Surround isolated bots to annex multiple tiles instantly.
Balanced Growth:
Expand into wilderness until ~50% population, then switch to fortifying vulnerable borders with 30‚Äì40% troop pushes.
Selective Posts:
New players often overbuild Defense Posts; reserve posts for chokepoints and critical city borders.
7. Advanced Tips & Meta
Port & Warship Cover:
Control sea lanes near ports to prevent naval raids; warships protect trade routes and deter amphibious flanks.
City Placement:
Build cities just behind Defense Posts; more cities ‚Üí higher max population ‚Üí larger reserves for defense.
Obstacle Integration:
Treat wilderness and terrain edges as natural obstacles; combine with built posts to channel attacks into kill zones.
Adaptive Defense:
Transition from pure turtle to counterattacks once opponent armies deplete overcoming posts, leveraging your economy.
Sample Defensive Layout
[This sample illustrates a mountainous chokepoint with staggered Defense Posts (blue diamonds), SAM Launcher rings (red triangles), and Missile Silos (gray circles) placed behind the main line, all anchored by cities (gold stars) for population support.]
Defend smarter, not harder.
By combining terrain, fortifications, and strategic structures, defenders in OpenFront.io can create resilient borders that punish attackers and secure victory through attrition.

OpenFront Pro - Your Ultimate OpenFront.io Companion
Gold Guide for OpenFront.io
Key Takeaways
Players generate and spend gold to expand and strengthen their empires.
Optimizing gold production
through worker management, conquest, and trade is crucial for victory.
1. Gold Basics
1.1 Gold Generation
Gold is generated passively each tick based on the number of workers (non-military population units) you maintain.
Base rate
: Approximately 1 gold per worker per tick, up to a cap determined by your total population capacity.
1.2 Gold Uses & Costs
Gold funds all structures and advanced units. Costs scale exponentially as you build more of each type:
|Structure/Unit|Price Formula|Maximum Price|
|‚Äî|‚Äî|‚Äî|
|Warship|250 000 √ó (warship_count + 1)|1 000 000|
|Port|125 000 √ó 2^(port_count)|1 000 000|
|Defense Post|50 000 √ó (defense_post_count + 1)|250 000|
|SAM Launcher|1 500 000 √ó (SAM_count + 1)|3 000 000|
|City|125 000 √ó 2^(city_count)|1 000 000|
|Missile Silo|1 000 000|N/A|
|Atom Bomb|750 000|N/A|
|Hydrogen Bomb|5 000 000|N/A|
|MIRV|25 000 000|N/A|
All prices and caps from the official wiki
.
2. Sources of Gold
|Source|Description|Notes|
|‚Äî|‚Äî|‚Äî|
|Passive Generation|Based on workers|Adjust troop/worker slider to increase workers (and gold) at the expense of troop strength .|
|Conquest (Annexation)|Instant gold payout when conquering a territory|You receive the target‚Äôs accumulated gold and cities‚Äô future gold yields. Surrounding a bot for full annex yields maximal payout .|
|Trade Routes|Ongoing gold via ports built on coastal tiles|Longer routes and stacking multiple ports on borders amplify gold flow exponentially (distance bonus applies) .|
|Plunder|Gold from besieged opponents|When multiple players attack the same target, the final blow awards gold to the attacker. Timing attacks for the ‚Äúlast hit‚Äù is essential .|
3. Maximizing Gold Production
Optimize Troop/Worker Ratio
Early game: Lower the troop slider slightly to boost workers, maximizing passive gold without crippling defense .
Mid/late game: Maintain enough troops to deter attacks, but add workers where safe.
Rapid Annexation
Target small‚Äêland bots first for quick annex payouts.
Use a high attack ratio (‚â• 200% of defender‚Äôs strength) to speed conquest and secure gold .
Trade Route Engineering
Build ports along your most distant borders to maximize distance bonuses.
Stack ports
‚Äîplacing multiple ports on adjacent coastal tiles compounds incoming gold .
Strategic Alliances & Betrayals
Form alliances to secure safe borders, then annex allied territory for dual payout (gold + assets).
Time betrayals to coincide with maximum city/port accumulation.
4. Advanced Tips
Port Saturation
: In custom lobbies, free port modes allow extreme port stacking, yielding billions of gold‚Äîuse sparingly, as server lag may ensue .
SAM Exploitation
: Late‚Äêgame SAM defense posts can indirectly generate gold by preserving territory and preventing enemy raids.
Atomic Arsenal
: Reserve gold for high-impact structures (e.g., MIRV) only after securing passive and trade incomes.

Frequently Asked Questions
When will the iOS app be released?
The iOS app is planned for development after the Steam Early Access release. We don't have a specific date yet, but we'll announce it through our community channels as soon as we have more information.
Will it be free like the PC version?
Yes, OpenFront will remain free-to-play on iOS, just like the PC version. We may introduce optional in-app purchases to support development, but the core game will always be free.
Can I play with PC players?
Yes! Cross-platform play is planned, so iOS players will be able to compete with PC and Android players in the same matches.
Will there be different game modes for mobile?
Absolutely! We're planning faster-paced "Blitz" modes with smaller maps specifically designed for mobile gaming sessions. These will be perfect for playing on the go.
What about the current mobile browser experience?
We're aware of the current limitations with mobile browsers, including input lag and control issues. The native iOS app will solve these problems with optimized touch controls and better performance.

A Message from Evan, Creator of OpenFront
E
Hey everyone,
First off, I want to thank all
1 million of you
who play openfront.io each month. Your support has been incredible, and I'm amazed by how this community has grown! I also want to give a special thanks to all the code contributors who have helped make OpenFront what it is today. As an open source project, this game has benefited tremendously from community contributions.
For the past 6 weeks, I've been working on this game
full-time, 7 days a week
, using all my vacation days to bring you updates and improvements. However, my vacation time is now running out, and I'm at a critical decision point: either return to my corporate job and put the game in maintenance mode (meaning updates will stop), or with your support, continue developing this game full-time with new features, better performance, and regular updates.
Why Patreon?
By becoming a patron, you're directly supporting ongoing development and ensuring the game continues to evolve rather than stagnate. Without enough support, I'll have no choice but to return to my day job, and updates will effectively stop.

What You'll Get
Currently: Nothing (For now)
I'm working on adding a subscriber tier, allowing you to choose your territory color, and get access to special cosmetic items.
OpenFront will never be pay to win.
Until that's in place, just know you'll be supporting future game updates. By allowing me to go full time, you can expect me to work on exciting new features and improvements.

Frequently Asked Questions
When will the Android app be released?
The Android app is planned for development after the iOS release. The exact timeline depends on iOS development progress, but we'll keep the community updated through our Discord and Reddit channels.
Why is Android coming after iOS?
We're prioritizing iOS first to focus our development resources and ensure quality. Once the iOS version is stable, we'll apply those learnings to create an excellent Android experience.
Will it work on my Android device?
The app will support Android 8.0+ with at least 3GB RAM. We're optimizing for a wide range of devices, from budget phones to flagship tablets.
Can I play with iOS and PC players?
Yes! Cross-platform play is a core feature, so Android players will be able to compete with PC and iOS players in the same matches.
What about the current browser experience on Android?
We know the current mobile browser experience has significant limitations. Some players report better performance with Opera GX, but the native Android app will solve all these issues with proper touch controls and optimized performance.
